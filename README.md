# Block-Cipher
Disclaimer: This project is done from scratch as per the requirements from RIT.

In This project, encode.c takes in a filename where the contents to be encoded are stored. The encoding is done and the encoded data is stored in the same file. Then, decode.c takes in the encoded(the same) filename, the decoding is done and the contents are displayed in the terminal.

The program also does different error checking to make sure the program runs smoothly.
This program is also memory efficient as dynamic memory allocation is used in critical regions and deallocation is done to make sure there is no memory leak.
